0.0s - 6.7s: Yes, okay fine. Thank you. I'm gonna start out today by just talking a little bit with you about
6.7s - 11.6s: your chief complaint. What brings you here today? Sure. My lift elbow has actually been bugging me a lot.
12.3s - 17.5s: Every once in a while I've been getting a little bit of pain extending my arm and going back to
17.5s - 23.0s: bending it. Really that's the primary reason I've come in. I've attempted to take a little bit
23.0s - 28.5s: of Tylenol to relieve the pain but it's not really seeming to help much. Okay. Before we talk a
28.5s - 32.3s: little bit more about that is there anything else that you want to talk with either me or Dr. Smith
32.3s - 40.5s: today? Not that I can think of now. Okay. Tell me more about this pain. It's just kind of a
40.5s - 46.8s: throbbing pain. It'll act up kind of randomly throughout the day. It doesn't sound specific to
46.8s - 52.6s: you know the morning or evening or even in the middle of the day or night. It just kind of randomly
52.6s - 58.3s: acts up. I would say excessively like when I'm doing work like after the dishes. It'll start
58.3s - 64.5s: to act up. If I you know lift one of my children up it'll start to act up. So any sort of exertion
64.5s - 69.4s: is kind of where I've noticed a lot of the pain coming from. And tell me when did it start for you?
70.2s - 73.4s: I would say in the air about maybe a week and a half to two weeks ago. Okay.
76.0s - 79.6s: And you described the pain as throbbing. Is there anything else about the pain in terms of the
79.6s - 85.0s: quality of the pain that you want to describe for me? No. Just really throbbing. Okay. It started
85.0s - 89.8s: about a week to two weeks ago. Okay. And do you recall what you were doing at the time that it
89.8s - 94.8s: started? I've been helping my husband clean out the garage lately and we were lifting some boxes.
96.0s - 100.6s: And that's kind of I didn't notice it at the moment but later in the evening started to act up.
100.6s - 106.5s: Okay. And I would like to hear about the little bit about the severity of it on a pain scale of
106.5s - 111.8s: one to ten, ten being the worst pain we've ever had. One or zero being no pain. At this
111.8s - 117.0s: wound, how bad is this pain? I would measure probably about a six or seven. Six or seven?
117.0s - 120.9s: It's become more of a nuisance than an actual physical pain. Okay.
123.7s - 129.2s: And is it a six or seven all the time? Whenever it starts to act up, yes. Okay.
131.2s - 135.1s: And how often a date is that happened? I would say maybe two to three times per day.
135.8s - 142.7s: Okay. Do you notice any pattern to that at all? No. Okay. Alrighty. And can you point exactly
142.7s - 147.3s: to where it is for me? The location of it exactly? It's kind of the area that just kind of wraps
147.3s - 150.7s: around the actual elbow. Okay. That is really bothering me.
152.7s - 157.5s: And does that pain go up your arm or down your arm or anywhere else on your arm? No, it stays
157.5s - 170.5s: right in that area. Is there anything else that goes on at the same time? Any other symptoms
170.5s - 174.6s: that happen? Anything else other than when the pain is happening there? Anything else going on
174.6s - 182.3s: for you? Not that I've noticed. No. Okay. Alrighty. Is there anything that makes it feel better?
183.1s - 189.6s: Nothing that completely gets rid of it. Tylenol will relieve it for a temporary period of time,
190.4s - 195.4s: but it hasn't gotten rid of it. Okay. And how much Tylenol do you take?
195.4s - 200.6s: I, whatever it says on the bottle, usually one to two tablets. And is that regular strength or
200.6s - 205.5s: extra strength? Regular strength. Okay. And you just take it across the counter at the normal
205.6s - 213.1s: direction from the bottle. Okay. And does anything make it worse? Like I mentioned, any sort of exertion,
214.0s - 220.1s: picking up a child's, doing the dishes. Pretty much daily kind of living out your ears. So using it?
220.1s - 227.9s: Yes. Okay. Have you seen anybody else for this complaint? No. What else have you tried other than
227.9s - 233.4s: the Tylenol and anything else other than the Tylenol? I've attempted to use a heating pad on it,
233.4s - 237.4s: and I've also attempted ice. Neither were successful. Okay.
240.9s - 244.9s: It sounds you've talked a little bit about how it's impacted, you know, you to be able to work in
244.9s - 249.1s: the garage or do the dishes or lift your child. Is there other impact on your life?
250.2s - 255.0s: Like I mentioned, it's more of a nuisance. There'll be times in the middle of the night that
255.0s - 259.4s: will start to act up. If I get up to go to the bathroom, I'll notice pain in my elbow.
259.4s - 263.5s: Does it wake you at night? It doesn't, but if I wake up in the middle of the night, it will
264.6s - 266.5s: trouble me and fall back. Okay.
269.4s - 275.0s: What do you think it is? I'm not quite sure. My best guess is maybe some sort of pulled muscle or
275.0s - 283.3s: something. Okay. But honestly, I don't know. All right. What I'd like to do now is just kind of go
283.3s - 286.9s: through all the things that you tell me and summarize for you. Just this information that I want to
286.9s - 290.9s: take back, but I want to make sure that I have it all correct. So if I've forgotten something or
290.9s - 296.0s: I've gotten something incorrect, please, please help me. Okay. You came to the clinic today for
296.0s - 300.9s: a complaint of left elbow pain. And it's pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or
300.9s - 306.8s: using it in some capacity. It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to
306.8s - 312.3s: three times during the day. What you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flexural
312.3s - 317.0s: bone, that's when it seems to be at its worst. It's gone on for about a week, maybe to two weeks
317.0s - 320.3s: when you think back on it. And it's centered out when you were helping your husband clean the
320.3s - 325.6s: garage and you were lifting locks of boxes. It's about a six to seven on a pain scale. Then you
325.6s - 329.8s: describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way
329.8s - 335.5s: of doing some things that you want to. You report that it happens probably two to three times a day
335.5s - 340.9s: and that the pain wraps around the joint completely. You've taken some Tylenol for it across the
340.9s - 346.5s: counter. You've taken that several times a day, not without much relief. That hasn't helped much.
346.5s - 350.9s: You've also tried a heating pad. You've tried some ice. That hasn't really helped either too much.
351.7s - 356.2s: It sounds like, again, you kept referring to it as a nuisance that it's just kind of getting in the
356.2s - 360.6s: way of your daily activities. Doesn't necessarily keep you up at night, but you do notice it at night
360.6s - 364.8s: when you wake up that it's still going on for you. So sleep doesn't seem to help much. And
364.8s - 369.9s: that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type. Is there anything I've forgotten
369.9s - 373.1s: or that you wanted to tell me about this? Not that I can think of no.
373.1s - 377.8s: All right. Thank you for telling me about your chief concern. I'm going to take it back to Dr. Smith.
377.8s - 379.8s: Thank you very much.
